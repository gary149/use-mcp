4. Copy your client ID to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_OPENROUTER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   ```

## Usage Tips

1. **Star your favorites** - This makes model selection much faster
2. **Use search** - With 39 models, search helps find what you need
3. **Filter by tools** - When using MCP tools, enable "Tools Only" filter
4. **Try different providers** - Each has unique models with different strengths

## Model Data Updates

Model data is fetched from models.dev API and can be updated with:

```bash
pnpm update-models
```

This will refresh the model list with the latest information from the API.

## Local Storage

The following preferences are saved locally:
- **Favorites**: `aiChatTemplate_favorites_v1`
- **Tokens**: `aiChatTemplate_token_[provider]`
- **Selected Model**: `aiChatTemplate_selectedModel`

## Troubleshooting

- **OAuth popup blocked**: Allow popups for this site
- **Authentication failed**: Check your API keys or re-authenticate
- **Model not working**: Verify the model supports the features you're using
- **Tools not showing**: Enable "Tools Only" filter when MCP tools are configured
